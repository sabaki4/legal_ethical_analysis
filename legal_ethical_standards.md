# Legal and Ethical Analysis

## Scenario 1: BankingCorp
**Legal Analysis:**
- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Sharing customer data with a third-party without explicit consent may violate data privacy regulations like GDPR.
- **Consumer Protection Laws**: Targeting financially vulnerable customers with payday loan offers might infringe upon consumer protection laws.

**Ethical Analysis:**
- **Exploitation of Vulnerable Customers**: Offering payday loans to financially struggling customers might exploit their vulnerable financial situation.
- **Lack of Transparency**: Not publicly disclosing the partnership and changes to terms and conditions lacks transparency and could deceive customers.

**Recommendations:**
- Obtain clear consent from customers before sharing their data with third-parties.
- Ensure transparency by publicly disclosing partnerships and changes to terms and conditions.
- Evaluate the ethical implications of partnering with businesses that could harm customers financially.

## Scenario 2: Treasure Hunters Game

**Legal Analysis:**
- **In-Game Purchases**: Offering in-game hints for purchase involves online transactions and must comply with relevant laws, especially regarding minors.
- **Intellectual Property Concerns**: Continuously adding new maps may raise issues related to copyright and intellectual property rights.

**Ethical Analysis:**
- **Creating Pay-to-Win Environment**: Monetising gameplay progression might create an unfair advantage for paying players, disadvantaging those who cannot afford purchases.
- **Encouraging Excessive Spending**: Multi-buy discounts and real-money purchases may encourage excessive spending, particularly among vulnerable populations.

**Recommendations:**
- Implement fair monetisation strategies that do not create a pay-to-win scenario.
- Offer alternative ways for players to unlock content without solely relying on real-money purchases.
- Ensure transparency regarding costs and benefits of in-game purchases.
